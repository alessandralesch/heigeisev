I have a Xbox One and my friend has a PS3. I could be completely off here, but it seems like there is a possibility of us being able to play together. I don't know a whole lot about the issue, but it seems as though, regardless of system, the game should transmit the same data, making the only problem connecting to a ps3 server (since the xbox one servers have more players in a game, I didn't think he'd be able to/should connect to a xbox one server).

This was little less than a year ago. It was May 2018 and I recently did a bunch of the doomsday heists (all on hard mode) so I was able to buy a bunch of stuff with it.

Good news! All of the fixes that we've been talking about in the Future's End Update have been sent off for certification, which is the next step toward releasing the update to you, the players.

They do not include issues with the Storm being overpowered, the Colossus being too weak, weak loot dropping from bosses, etc. Those are not bugs, just a feature. TL;DR - Apple makes no distinction between an OS update and an OS upgrade. It's surprising for many people when they hear I'm on a metered connection at home; since I have access to the company's high-speed connection and I have limited ISP options where I live, I use a 4G connection at home (it's actually quite cheap and hasn't let me down so far). Now, I have no theoretical objection to security updates, working as a sysadmin, but Apple push their new OSes with the same tenacity of Microsoft. There seemed to be a lot of confusion in this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/b43egy/xim_users_on_console_are_an_absolute_joke/) regarding whether or not it's considered cheating to utilize XIM to play Apex (or any other game) on console.

I'll make this fairly brief. I logged in to play some yesterday prior to Season of the Drifter starting this Tuesday and noticed my game was unusually sluggish. It also felt as though my mouse setting and sensitivity were messed up even though I had been comfortable with the settings I have for quite a long time now. At first I thought it may have been the latest NVIDIA driver so I reverted and tried each of the last 4 official versions, and the problem was still there. In addition to sensitivit. After the golden 90s, the mid 2000s were certainly not a great time to be playing on PC. A lot of console exclusive titles (including Epic Games and them blaming piracy for their abandonment of the PC), crappy ports, Microsoft's greatly beloved Games for Windows Live service, including trying to get PC players to pay for online and anti-piracy measures like SecuROM. Steam continued to provide free multiplayer throughout the entire time and at some point publishers started to realize that there.

I am a player of the game just like you and i do these posts because i enjoy doing them and i know its helpful to many of you. If you have any issues with this actual post, let me know.

And if people keep being childish in the comments and even send me private messages about how shitty For some reason people seem to think that the reveal that Microsoft is bringing the Xbox Live SDK to the Switch is confirmation that Microsoft is working with Nintendo to bring Xbox games to the Switch.

All these articles are saying is that Microsoft is giving developers access to the Xbox Live XDK to be able to add Xbox Live to their mobile and Switch games as they choose. You know how with Minecraft on mobile and on Switch
